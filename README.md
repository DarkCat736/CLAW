# CLAW - <i>v0.2.0 (BETA VERSION)</i>
A platform for students to stay organized and work together! Currently CLAW has a fully functional checklist, an assignment tracker in development, and many more features including Team Projects on the way in the future!

<b><i>UPDATE NOTICE!!!</i></b> The MYSQL_DB_HOST and MYSQL_DB_NAME fields are now required in the .env file for the BETA version of CLAW. Check the BETA setup instructions for more details.

<i>Official host: Beta host coming soon...</i>

<i>If the official host is inaccessible please wait at least 20 minutes before making a bug report. The server automatically restarts after 15 minutes of network failures which generally fixes most connection issues.</i>

<i>Known issues: [read here](https://github.com/DarkCat736/CLAW/issues/1)</i>

<b>Setup:</b>

[This guide](https://github.com/DarkCat736/CLAW/wiki/CLAW-BETA-Setup) has setup instructions.

<hr>
<i>WARNING: If you host CLAW using a program such as apache, you may have to add to your VirtualHost configuration to allow encoded slashes in URLs (Example fix: `AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode`). CLAW's authorization API <b>WILL NOT WORK</b> and will return 404 errors without these changes.</i>
