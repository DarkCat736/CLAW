<hr>
<i>WARNING: If you host CLAW using a program such as apache, you may have to add to your VirtualHost configuration to allow encoded slashes in URLs (Example fix: `AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode`). CLAW's authorization API <b>WILL NOT WORK</b> and will return 404 errors without these changes.</i>
